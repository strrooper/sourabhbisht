                                Okay so basically, I belong to a small village <b>Kansola</b> in the Chamoli district <b>Uttarakhand</b>. <br/> 
                                <b>Surviving</b> in Kansola means that you have to walk miles to fulfill all your basic needs  as there's no facility available. <br/>
                                But these hurdles make me realize that you should always "<b>Try till you make it</b>", being a village boy I was far off technology <br/> 
                                stuff so that was the reason the technology attracted me the most once I migrated to city for further studies. There I interacted <br/>
                                with a new environment, where I found a very interesting <b>machine</b> called a "<b>computer !!</b>" that hits my mind completely. <br/>
                                After that, I found a new kind of <b>excitement</b> in me to learn about how these things work. As I belong to a middle family <br/> 
                                it's very hard for me to afford a computer at that time so I started learning through my school classes and develop my skills <br/>
                                as I can.The <b>beginning</b> of my real <b>journey</b> start when I was in my 10th standard and my father bought me a computer,<br/>
                                it's time to beat the situation. <br/>
                                So, I started putting my all hard work into learning the <b>programming</b> languages in my 11th standard and I knew I'm going to <br/>
                                learn this at the end of my 12th standard. We all have heard many times about the life-changing <b>opportunity</b>,<br/> 
                                yes it's really happened to me as well when I joined a coaching class where I meet <b>Sanjeev sir</b>. He's the one who <b>enlightens</b> <br/>
                                my path towards the right way, he taught me <b>PHP</b> In the easiest way by using tactics that really enhance my skills and also help<br/> 
                                me to understand how <b>Facebook's</b> back end operates. By getting this knowledge I'm able to create a base <b>structure</b> of Facebook,<br/> 
                                after that, I have also learned some other languages like <b>C++</b> . <br/>And yes I learned php first , not C.<br/>
                                As I always want to make my career in the technology field, because I know that I have the potential to create useful solutions<br/> 
                                that will be going to help society.It's very heart-wrenching that I haven't learned much during my <b>graduation</b>, but yes I really <br/>
                                get to know how to tackle the problem and how to use the logic which is required to become a good programmer.<br/>
                                After completing my graduation i jumped into the IT industry to gain real-life <b>experience</b> and start my career as a software developer.<br/> 
                                As of now I'm <b>growing</b> and learning day by day which is really required for every person not only for a programmer because <br/>
                                we are facing many problems in our real life and if we know how to tackle <b>problems</b> with the right approach. <br/>
                                Then nothing will stop us, and we will easily analyze the problem and convert it into code, and still, if we are not able to <br/>
                                find the solution then we should change our approach. We should never lose our hope always try with a <b>positive</b> approach, <br/>
                                we will definitely going to find a solution. Hence, this is me who never stops and always ready for the situation that will <br/>
                                force me to think <b>out of the box</b> and I'll be back with an effective <b>solution</b> for that specific problem.
